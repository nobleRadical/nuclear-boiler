Simple Compat Mod that makes the Nuclear Furnace from Alex's Caves act as a Boiler Superheater for Create Boilers.
Simply place a Nuclear Furnace underneath a boiler and it will heat the boiler to the max.
One Nuclear Furnace can fully heatÂ up to 4 boilers at once, by placing 4 boilers adjacent to each other and the nuclear furnace directly underneath all of them.



In addition, this mod extends the lifetime of a uranium rod from about 60 seconds to about 1000. This can be disabled in config.
